# CoWorkIt

**CoWorkIt** is a platform where users can book coworking spaces and rooms for meetings, conferences, or creative work. Users can explore available rooms and book them. To post or book a room, users must be signed in. The app ensures that rooms can't be booked by multiple users simultaneously.
